Country-wise Product Trend Analysis and Sales Prediction


Overview:

The Country-wise Product Trend Analysis and Sales Prediction project aims to analyze product sales data across different countries to identify trends and predict future sales. The project leverages historical sales data to forecast future demand, helping businesses make informed decisions regarding inventory management, marketing strategies, and product launches.


Features

- Trend Analysis: Identifies product sales trends in different countries, highlighting seasonal patterns, top-selling products, and market shifts.
- Sales Prediction: Predicts future sales using machine learning models, providing country-specific forecasts.
- Visualization: Provides detailed visualizations of sales trends, product performance, and prediction results.
- Country-wise Comparison: Allows for comparison of sales trends and predictions across different countries.


Dataset

The dataset includes historical sales data from multiple countries, with the following key features:

- Date: The date of the sales transaction.
- Country: The country where the sales occurred.
- Product: The specific product that was sold.
- Sales: The number of units sold or the revenue generated.
- Category: The product category or type.
- Other relevant features: Such as promotion details, store type, etc.

The dataset should be a CSV file with the aforementioned columns.


Installation

Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended for interactive analysis)
- Virtualenv (optional but recommended)

Clone the Repository

bash

Copy code

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/product-trend-analysis-sales-prediction.git

cd product-trend-analysis-sales-prediction

Create a Virtual Environment

bash

Copy code

python -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

Install Dependencies

bash

Copy code

pip install -r requirements.txt


Usage

1. Data Preprocessing
   
Before analyzing trends and predicting sales, preprocess the data by running the preprocess.py script:

bash

Copy code

python preprocess.py

This script will clean the data, handle missing values, and prepare it for analysis.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   
To explore the data and visualize trends, open the Product_Trend_Analysis.ipynb Jupyter Notebook:

bash

Copy code


jupyter notebook Product_Trend_Analysis.ipynb
In the notebook, youâ€™ll find:

- Visualization of sales trends by country.
- Analysis of top-selling products and categories.
- Identification of seasonal patterns in different markets.

3. Sales Prediction
   
To predict future sales, run the sales_prediction.py script. You can specify the model you want to use and the country for which you want to make predictions:

bash

Copy code

python sales_prediction.py --model <model_name> --country <country_name>

Replace <model_name> with the machine learning model (e.g., linear_regression, random_forest) and <country_name> with the country for which you want to predict sales.

4. Running the Web App (Optional)

If your project includes a web application for real-time trend analysis and sales prediction, you can run the Flask app:

bash

Copy code

export FLASK_APP=app.py

flask run

Then visit http://127.0.0.1:5000/ in your browser to interact with the app.

                         
Visualizations

The project includes a range of visualizations to help understand product trends and predictions, such as:

- Sales Trends by Country: Line charts showing sales trends over time for different countries.
- Top Products: Bar charts highlighting the best-selling products in each market.
- Seasonal Patterns: Heatmaps or line charts depicting seasonal variations in product sales.
- Prediction Results: Graphs showing actual vs. predicted sales for selected countries.

Model Training

To train the sales prediction models, run the train_model.py script. This will preprocess the data, train the model, and save it for future use:

bash

Copy code

python train_model.py --model <model_name>
