## ⚙️ How It Works

### 1. Data Preprocessing 🧹
- Clean and preprocess the sales dataset to handle missing values and formatting issues.
- Create relevant features for analysis, such as sales trends over time by country.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📊
- Visualize sales trends to identify patterns and anomalies across different countries.
- Analyze the relationship between various factors and product sales.

### 3. Sales Prediction Model Development 🛠️
Trained using various machine learning algorithms:
- **Linear Regression**
- **Random Forest**
- **XGBoost**

### 4. Model Performance Metrics 🏅
Evaluated using metrics:
- **R² Score**: 0.87
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: 300
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: 450
